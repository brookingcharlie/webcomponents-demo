* [HTML Imports](imports/) (link to demo)

## Browser support

As of August 2015:

* Works in Chrome/Chromium and should also work other WebKit-based browsers, e.g. Opera.
* You need to make a configuration change in Firefox
  (see [this MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)).
* To workaround lack of support in other browsers, see <http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/>.

For an overview of browser implementation progress, see

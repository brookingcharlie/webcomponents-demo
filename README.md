# Web Components demo

Code examples showing usage of Web Components standards:

* [Custom Elements](custom-elements/)
* [Shadow DOM](shadow-dom/)
* HTML Imports (no demo yet)
* HTML Templates (no demo yet)

## Browser support

As of August 2015:

* Works in Chrome/Chromium and should also work other WebKit-based browsers, e.g. Opera.
* You need to make a configuration change in Firefox
  (see [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components](this MDN article)).
* To workaround lack of support in other browsers, see <http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/>.

For an overview of browser implementation progress, see

# Web Components demo

Code examples showing usage of Web Components standards:

* [Custom Elements](custom-elements/)

Browser support (as of August 2015):

* Works in Chrome/Chromium (should also work in Opera and other WebKit-based browsers).
* Works with a configuration change in Firefox
  (see <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components>).
* For polyfills to workaround lack of browser support, see

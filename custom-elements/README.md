# Custom Elements demo

Simple example showing the definition, registration, and usage of a Custom Element.

As of August 2015, this example is only supported by Chrome/Chromium.
For support in other browsers, look at Polymer's
[web components polyfills](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/platform.html).
